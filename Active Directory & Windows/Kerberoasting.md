It is a method used to extract and crack service account passwords that utilize Kerberos authentication within a Windows Active Directory environment. This attack targets accounts with Kerberos Service Principal Names (SPNs) set, allowing attackers to request encrypted service tickets from the domain controller.

#### **How It Works**:

1. **Kerberos Authentication**:
    
    - In Active Directory, service accounts (used by services running on domain-joined machines) are assigned service principal names (SPNs). These SPNs are used to authenticate services via Kerberos.
    - When a client wants to access a service, it requests a **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)** from the **Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)** for that service.
2. **TGS Request**:
    
    - The attacker identifies service accounts in the environment (typically using tools like **BloodHound** or **Kerberos enumeration**).
    - The attacker requests TGS tickets for these service accounts. This does not require any credentials, just the SPN of the service.
3. **Service Ticket**:
    
    - The KDC issues a **TGS** for the service account. This ticket is encrypted with the service account’s password hash, which the attacker cannot directly access at this point.
4. **Offline Cracking**:
    
    - The attacker extracts the TGS ticket, which contains the encrypted hash of the service account’s password.
    - The ticket can be cracked offline using tools like **Hashcat** or **John the Ripper** to obtain the plaintext password of the service account.
5. **Privilege Escalation**:
    
    - Once the attacker cracks the password, they can use it to impersonate the service account, which may have elevated privileges in the domain, granting them further access to sensitive systems or data.

#### **Steps in Targeted Kerberoasting**:

1. **Enumerate Service Accounts**:
    
- Use tools like **BloodHound**, **Kerberos Enumeration**, or **Nmap** to identify service accounts that have SPNs associated with them.
    
```bash
impacket-GetUserSPNs -request -dc-ip target_ip domain_name/user
```

2. **Request TGS for Identified Service Accounts**:

- After identifying the target SPNs, you can use the script to request TGS tickets for those service accounts.

- `-u`: Username for authentication
- `-p`: Password for the user
- `-d`: Domain of the target network
- `-t`: Target SPN (the service account you want to target)

```bash
python targetedKerberoast.py -u <username> -p <password> -d <domain> -t <target_spn>
```


3. **Extract and Save the TGS Ticket**:
    
    - The TGS ticket is saved in a file, which contains the encrypted hash of the service account password.
    - This is typically done using **Mimikatz**, **Impacket**, or **Rubeus**.

4. **Crack the Hash Offline**:
    
    - The encrypted hash is cracked using password-cracking tools like **Hashcat** or **John the Ripper**.
```bash
hashcat -m 13100 service-ticket.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
