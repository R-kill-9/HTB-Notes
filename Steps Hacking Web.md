1. **Reconnaissance**:
    
    - **Passive Reconnaissance**: Gather information without interacting with the target directly (Google dorks, social media, WHOIS lookups).
    - **Active Reconnaissance**: Engage with the target to gather data (port scanning, ping sweeps).
2. **Check Software Version**:
    
    - Identify versions of web servers, CMS platforms, libraries, and frameworks in use.
    - Use tools like Wappalyzer or built-in error messages to determine software versions.
3. **Security Misconfigurations**:

	- Identify and exploit security misconfigurations, such as default credentials, verbose error messages, or improper file permissions.
4. **Enumeration**:
    
    - Enumerate directories, subdomains, and hidden files using tools like DirBuster, Gobuster, or Wfuzz.
5. **Local File Inclusion (LFI) / Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**:
    - Test for file inclusion vulnerabilities by manipulating file paths in input fields or URLs.
6. **SQL Injections**:
    
    - Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities in input fields, headers, URLs, and cookies.
    - Use tools like sqlmap to automate testing and exploitation.
7. **XSS**:
    
    - Test for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities by injecting malicious scripts into input fields and URLs.
    - Use tools like XSSer or manual techniques to identify and exploit XSS.
8. **Analyze Requests and Responses**:
    
    - Inspect HTTP requests and responses for sensitive information, potential vulnerabilities, and clues for further attacks.
    - Use proxies like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or browser developer tools.
9. **Testing for Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**:

	- Test if users can access data or functionality of other users by manipulating object references in requests.
