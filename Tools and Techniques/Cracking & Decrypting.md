# hash-identifier
The main purpose of **hashid** is to identify the hash algorithm used so that you can select the appropriate tool to work with it, such as a cracking tool or integrity verification tool.
```bash
hash-identifier
<hash>
```

# hydra
Hydra supports a wide range of protocols, including HTTP, FTP, SMTP, Telnet, SSH, and many others. It works by sending multiple login attempts to the target system using a wordlist or custom dictionary file that contains potential usernames and passwords. Hydra then systematically tries each combination until it finds a successful login or exhausts all possibilities.
```bash
# password list example: 10-million-password-list-top-1000000.txt
# IP example: 10.10.10.10
# service example: ssh
# if you want to use a list of users the flag is -L
hydra -l <username> -P <password_list_path> <service>://<IP_or_domain_name> 
```

## Using hydra in a web login page
It can be useful intercept the petition with burp for extract the different fields. 
- url_path_page = Can be seen next to POST in the intercepted petition. It makes reference to the location of the login page inside the server.
- error_message: You need to do a wrong petition to obtain this field.
```bash
# t = threads
hydra -t 64 -l <username> -P <password_file_path> <IP_or_domain_name> http-post-form "<url_path_page>:username=<username>&password=^PASS^:<error_message>"
```
# hashcat
It's a password cracking tool used for recovering passwords from various hash types. Hashcat supports a wide range of hash algorithms, including common ones like MD5, SHA1, SHA256, as well as more advanced ones like bcrypt, scrypt, and Argon2. It can handle both single hashes and hash lists, making it useful for cracking passwords stored in databases, files, or captured network traffic.
### Parameters:
- The `-a` parameter (attack mode) in Hashcat determines the type of attack to be performed. Here are some common options:

	- `-a 0`: Dictionary attack. Hashcat will try different words or word combinations from a predefined dictionary.
	- `-a 1`: Brute-force attack. Hashcat will try all possible combinations of characters until a match is found.
	- `-a 3`: Mask attack. Hashcat allows specifying a custom pattern or mask to generate possible word combinations.
	- Other modes are also available, such as custom rules (`-a 6`) or hybrid attacks (`-a 7`) that combine multiple approaches.

- The `-m` parameter (hash type) indicates the type of hash to be cracked. Hashcat supports a wide range of hash algorithms, and each has an associated identification number. For example:

	- `-m 0`: MD5
	- `-m 100`: SHA1
	- `-m 500`: HMAC-SHA256
	- `-m 1800`: sha512crypt

```bash
# wordlist example: /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 <hash_file> <wordlist>
```

# John the Ripper
**John the Ripper** is a free password cracking software tool. It is among the  most frequently used password testing and breaking programs as it combines a number of  password crackers into one package, autodetects password hash types, and includes a  
customizable cracker. It can be run against various encrypted password formats  including several crypt password hash types most commonly found on various Unix  versions (based on DES, MD5, or Blowfish), Kerberos AFS, and Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 LM  
hash.


## Cracking password

```bash
# wordlist example: /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
john -wordlist=<wordlist> <hash_file>
```
Once we have already used the previous command, we can see the password and username found using:
```bash
john --show <hash_file>
```

## Cracking a zip file
1. **Convert the ZIP file to a hash format**:

First, you need to use the `zip2john` tool to convert the ZIP file into a hash that John the Ripper can work with.

```bash
zip2john <zip_file> > <hash_file_generated>
```

2. **Crack the hash file**:

Once you have the hash file, you can use **John the Ripper** with a wordlist or password list to try to discover the password.

```bash
john -wordlist=<wordlist> hash_file_generated
```

3. **View the result**:

Once John has finished trying passwords, you can view the found password with this command:

```bash
john -wordlist=<wordlist> hash_file_generated
```


## Cracking a SSH Key
If you want to **crack the password of an SSH key** (e.g., if the private key is protected by a password), you can use `ssh2john` to convert the SSH key to a format John the Ripper can handle. Here are the steps:

1. **Convert the SSH key to a hash**:

Use `ssh2john` to convert a private SSH key into a hash format. The output file will contain the hash of the SSH key, which can be processed by John the Ripper.

```bash
ssh2john <private_key_file> > <hash_file_generated>
```

2. **Crack the hash file**:

Use John the Ripper with a password list to attempt to discover the password for the private key.

```bash
john --wordlist=<wordlist> <hash_file_generated>
```

3. **View the result**:

Once John has finished trying passwords, you can view the found password with this command:

```bash
john -wordlist=<wordlist> hash_file_generated
```

## Cracking .kdbx Files (KeePass)
If you want to **crack the password** of a `.kdbx` file (KeePass), John the Ripper can be used with the help of an additional tool like `keepass2john` to convert the KeePass file into a hash.

1. **Convert the .kdbx file to a hash**:

Use `keepass2john` to convert the `.kdbx` file into a format that John the Ripper can handle. This command will extract the hash from the KeePass file:

```bash
keepass2john <file.kdbx> > <hash_file_generated>
```

2. **Crack the hash file**:

Now, use **John the Ripper** with a wordlist to attempt to crack the password for the KeePass file.

```bash
john --wordlist=<wordjohn --wordlist=<wordlist> <hash_file_generated>
list> <hash_file_generated>
```

3. **View the result**:

Once John has finished trying passwords, you can view the found password with this command:

```bash
john -wordlist=<wordlist> hash_file_generated
```

## Cracking a .pwsafe3 File (Password Safe)

If you want to **crack the password** of a `.pwsafe3` file (Password Safe), you can use **John the Ripper** to attempt to crack the password. Hereâ€™s how you do it:

1. **Convert the .pwsafe3 file to a hash:**

First, you need to convert the `.pwsafe3` file into a format that John the Ripper can process. You can use the `pwsafe2john` tool, which extracts the hash from the Password Safe file.

```bash
pwsafe2john <file.pwsafe3> > <hash_file_generated>
```

This command will output the hash into a file (e.g., `hash_file_generated`), which John the Ripper can then use.

 2. **Crack the hash file**:

Next, use **John the Ripper** with a wordlist to try cracking the password. You can use any standard wordlist (e.g., `rockyou.txt`).

```bash
john --wordlist=<wordlist> <hash_file_generated>
```



# openssl
**OpenSSL** can be used through the command line to perform various cryptographic operations, such as generating and managing SSL/TLS certificates, encrypting and decrypting data, creating digital signatures, and more. It supports a wide range of cryptographic algorithms and protocols.

One common and straightforward use case of OpenSSL is generating a self-signed SSL certificate for testing or development purposes. Here's an example of how to generate a self-signed certificate using OpenSSL:

- `req`: This subcommand is used for certificate requests and management.
- `-x509`: This option tells OpenSSL to create a self-signed certificate instead of a certificate signing request (CSR).
- `-newkey rsa:2048`: It generates a new RSA private key of 2048 bits.
- `-keyout mykey.pem`: Specifies the output file for the generated private key (mykey.pem).
- `-out mycert.pem`: Specifies the output file for the generated self-signed certificate (mycert.pem).
- `-days 365`: Sets the validity period of the certificate to 365 days.
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout mykey.pem -out mycert.pem -days 365
```
