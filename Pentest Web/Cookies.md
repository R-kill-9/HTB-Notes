From a cybersecurity perspective, cookies are often valuable targets for attackers because they contain data related to user sessions, authentication, preferences, or tracking information. Below are the main ways cookies can be exploited offensively:
## Session Hijacking

- Cookies often store **session identifiers** (e.g., `PHPSESSID`, `JSESSIONID`), which link a user's browser to their authenticated session on the server. If an attacker can steal this cookie, they can impersonate the user without needing their login credentials.
- Common ways attackers steal session cookies:
    - **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: If an attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a vulnerable web application, they can capture cookies that are not protected by the **HttpOnly** flag.
    - **Network Sniffing**: If cookies are transmitted over HTTP instead of HTTPS, attackers can intercept them by eavesdropping on unencrypted network traffic.

## HttpOnly Flag 
Cookies without the **HttpOnly** flag can be accessed by scripts running in the browser. If an attacker manages to inject malicious JavaScript into your application (e.g., through an XSS attack), they could directly steal sensitive cookies, like session identifiers.

## Secure Flag 

The **Secure** flag ensures that cookies are only sent over encrypted HTTPS connections. Without this flag, cookies could be transmitted in plain text over HTTP, making them vulnerable to interception by attackers monitoring network traffic (e.g., on public Wi-Fi).

## SameSite
The **SameSite** attribute mitigates Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and some forms of cross-origin information leakage by controlling whether cookies are sent with cross-site requests.

- **SameSite Attribute Options**:
    
    - `Strict`: Cookies are only sent in requests originating from the same site. This provides the highest security but may impact usability (e.g., third-party integrations).
    - `Lax`: Cookies are sent with safe HTTP methods (e.g., `GET`) in cross-site requests but are excluded from cross-origin POST requests.
    - `None`: Cookies are sent in all cross-site requests but must have the **Secure** flag set.
