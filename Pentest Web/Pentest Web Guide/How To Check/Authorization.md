### Test for Path Traversal

Path traversal vulnerabilities allow an attacker to access files and directories stored outside the intended folder. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files. To test for path traversal, you can manipulate the URL or request parameters. Use the following command:
```bash
curl -I http://example.com/resource?file=../../../../etc/passwd
```
This attempts to access the `/etc/passwd` file by traversing directories. The server's response will indicate whether the attack was successful, showing either the contents of the file or an error message.

### Test for Bypassing Authorization Schema

Bypassing authorization checks can allow unauthorized users to access restricted areas or functions. To test this, modify the request parameters or headers to see if you can access restricted resources.

### Test for Vertical Access Control Problems (Privilege Escalation)

Vertical access control issues occur when a user with insufficient permissions can access resources meant for users with higher privileges. To test this, you can try accessing administrative functions as a regular user.
### Test for Horizontal Access Control Problems

Horizontal access control problems arise when users at the same privilege level can access each other's resources. Test this by trying to access another user's data with a valid session:
```bash
curl -I --cookie "session_id=user_session_token" http://example.com/user/profile?id=another_user_id
```
If the application allows this access, it suggests a lack of proper authorization checks between users with the same privileges.
### Test for Missing Authorization

Missing authorization checks can expose sensitive endpoints. To test for this, directly access sensitive resources without authentication.
