### Test for User Enumeration

Check if the application provides different error messages or responses based on valid and invalid usernames during the login process. User enumeration can lead to attackers identifying valid usernames for further attacks. Use automated tools or manual testing to determine if responses differ based on the username validity.

### Test for Authentication Bypass

Attempt to access protected resources without proper authentication. This can include manipulating URL parameters, cookies, or session tokens to bypass the login process. Look for vulnerabilities such as missing access controls that could allow unauthorized access.

### Test for Bruteforce Protection

Assess whether the application implements measures to prevent brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints. This includes checking for account lockouts after a certain number of failed login attempts, delays between successive login attempts, or CAPTCHAs after multiple failures.

###  Test Password Quality Rules

Examine the password policies enforced during account creation and password changes. Ensure that the application requires strong passwords (e.g., minimum length, complexity rules) to mitigate the risk of easily guessable passwords. Use weak passwords to see if they are accepted or if appropriate error messages are returned.

### Test Remember Me Functionality

Evaluate the "Remember Me" feature for secure implementation. Ensure that persistent sessions are not stored insecurely and that they expire after a reasonable duration. Test whether the session is properly invalidated when the user logs out.

### Test for Autocomplete on Password Forms/Input

Inspect the password input fields to determine if the `autocomplete` attribute is correctly set to "off." This helps prevent browsers from storing and autofilling passwords, enhancing security for sensitive data entry.

### Test Password Reset and/or Recovery

Test the password reset functionality for security flaws. Ensure that the process requires proper validation of the user's identity and that temporary tokens sent via email or SMS are secure and have an expiration time.

### Test Password Change Process

Examine the password change mechanism to ensure it verifies the current password before allowing a change. Additionally, ensure that appropriate notifications are sent when passwords are changed, and that the new password follows established security policies.

### Test CAPTCHA

Check if CAPTCHA is implemented on sensitive forms (e.g., login, password recovery) to mitigate automated attacks. Evaluate the effectiveness of the CAPTCHA used, ensuring itâ€™s challenging enough for bots but user-friendly for legitimate users.

### Test Multi-Factor Authentication

Assess whether multi-factor authentication (MFA) is available and functioning correctly. Ensure that it requires users to provide additional verification methods (e.g., SMS codes, authenticator apps) when logging in, especially for sensitive actions.

### Test for Logout Functionality Presence

Verify the presence and proper implementation of a logout feature. Ensure that the session is properly terminated and that the user cannot access protected resources after logging out. Test for session fixation vulnerabilities by logging in again after logout.

### Test for Cache Management on HTTP (e.g., Pragma, Expires, Max-age)

Review HTTP headers related to caching, such as `Pragma`, `Expires`, and `Cache-Control`, to ensure sensitive pages (like login, password reset) are not cached by browsers. Proper configuration helps prevent unauthorized access to cached pages.

### Test for Default Logins

Check for default or hard-coded credentials in the application. Many applications may ship with default usernames and passwords (like `admin/admin`). Ensure these are either changed during setup or disabled to prevent unauthorized access.

### Test for User-Accessible Authentication History

Evaluate whether users can access their authentication history, which can be a useful feature for tracking unauthorized access. Ensure the implementation is secure and does not expose sensitive information.

### Test for Out-of-Channel Notification of Account Lockouts and Successful Password Changes

Ensure that the application sends notifications (e.g., email or SMS) to users when significant account actions occur, such as lockouts or password changes. This helps users monitor their accounts for suspicious activities.

### Test for Consistent Authentication Across Applications with Shared Authentication Schema / SSO

If the application uses Single Sign-On (SSO) or a shared authentication schema, verify that the authentication process is consistent across all applications. Check that logging out from one application effectively logs the user out from all connected applications.
