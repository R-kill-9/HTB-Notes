### Check SSL Version, Algorithms, Key Length

- Use tools like **OpenSSL** or **nmap** to check the SSL/TLS version, supported algorithms, and key length.

```bash
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -cipher 'ALL' | grep 'Cipher'
```
Or, using nmap:
```bash
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 example.com
```

### Check for Digital Certificate Validity (Duration, Signature, and CN)

- Use **OpenSSL** to retrieve the certificate and check its validity:
```bash
echo | openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 | openssl x509 -noout -dates -subject -issuer
```
This command provides the certificate's start and end dates, subject name (Common Name), and issuer details. Validate that the certificate has not expired and the CN matches the domain.

### Check Credentials Only Delivered Over HTTPS

- Inspect the login form and any credential submission endpoints using browser developer tools (Network tab). Ensure that any requests that include sensitive data (like passwords) are sent over HTTPS. You can also use **curl** to check the response of a login request to see if it is redirected to HTTPS.


### Check That the Login Form is Delivered Over HTTPS

- Access the login page in a web browser and check the URL in the address bar. It should begin with `https://`. Additionally, use the developer tools to inspect the form element and verify the action attribute (it should also point to an HTTPS URL).

### Check Session Tokens Only Delivered Over HTTPS

- Check the cookies that store session tokens by inspecting them in browser developer tools (Application tab). Ensure that the cookies have the `Secure` flag set, meaning they are only transmitted over HTTPS. Additionally, check the network traffic for token transmission to ensure they are sent over secure connections.

### Check if HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is in Use

- Use a web browser or tools like **curl** to check for the HSTS header in the HTTP response:
```bash
curl -I https://example.com
```

Look for the `Strict-Transport-Security` header in the response. If itâ€™s present, verify its directives (e.g., `max-age`, `includeSubDomains`) to ensure HSTS is correctly implemented.
