### Establish How Session Management is Handled in the Application

Understanding how session management is implemented is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities. Examine whether the application uses tokens stored in cookies, URLs, or local storage. If tokens are in URLs, they could be exposed in logs or browser history. Use the following command to inspect how sessions are established:
```bash
curl -I http://example.com/login
```
This command fetches the headers of the login page, allowing you to review how session management is configured.

### Check Session Tokens for Cookie Flags (httpOnly and Secure)

Security flags for session cookies are vital for protecting user sessions. The `HttpOnly` flag prevents JavaScript from accessing cookies, mitigating the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The `Secure` flag ensures that cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS. To check these flags, use:
```bash
curl -c cookies.txt http://example.com
cat cookies.txt
```
This command saves cookies to a file, which you can inspect to confirm the presence of the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags.

### Check Session Cookie Scope (Path and Domain)

Session cookie scope is defined by the `Path` and `Domain` attributes. Proper configuration restricts the cookieâ€™s access to specific paths or subdomains, reducing the chance of cookie theft. You can check the cookie scope with:
```bash
curl -I --cookie "session_id=your_session_token" http://example.com/path
```

This command verifies that the cookie is being used in the correct context.

### Check Session Cookie Duration (Expires and Max-Age)

The lifespan of session cookies should be limited to reduce the risk of long-term exposure. Use the following command to check the cookie's `Expires` or `Max-Age` settings:

```bash
curl -I http://example.com
```

Look for the relevant headers in the response to ensure they reflect a secure duration.

### Check Session Termination After a Maximum Lifetime

Implementing a maximum session lifetime is essential for security. Test this functionality by logging in and observing the application's behavior after the defined period:
```bash
curl -I --cookie "session_id=your_session_token" http://example.com/dashboard
```
### Check Session Termination After Logout

When a user logs out, the session should be properly invalidated. Test this by logging in, logging out, and then trying to access protected resources:
```bash
curl -I --cookie "session_id=your_session_token" http://example.com/logout
curl -I --cookie "session_id=your_session_token" http://example.com/dashboard
```
Confirm that the application denies access after logout.

### Test to See if Users Can Have Multiple Simultaneous Sessions

Check whether the application allows multiple active sessions by logging in from different browsers or devices:
```bash
curl -I --cookie "session_id=your_session_token" http://example.com/dashboard
```
Use different sessions to see if access is granted simultaneously.
### Test Session Cookies for Randomness

To prevent session fixation attacks, ensure that session tokens are sufficiently random. Generate multiple tokens and analyze their randomness:
```bash
for i in {1..10}; do curl -I http://example.com/login done
```
Examine the tokens generated in each response to assess their randomness.

### Confirm That New Session Tokens Are Issued on Login, Role Change, and Logout

For enhanced security, the application should issue new session tokens during critical events. Use the following commands:
```bash
curl -I -d "username=user&password=pass" http://example.com/login
curl -I --cookie "session_id=your_session_token" http://example.com/change_role
```
Verify that a new session token is issued after these actions.
### Test for Consistent Session Management Across Applications with Shared Session Management

If the application is part of a suite using shared session management, confirm that session state is consistent:
```bash
curl -I -d "username=user&password=pass" http://app1.example.com/login
curl -I --cookie "session_id=your_session_token" http://app2.example.com/dashboard
```
Check that logging in to one application reflects the session state in others.
### Test for Session Puzzling

Session puzzling can be tested by attempting to use another user's session token to access their data:
```bash
curl -I --cookie "session_id=other_user_token" http://example.com/user_data
```
Ensure the application properly associates actions with the correct user session.

### Test for CSRF and Clickjacking

Check for anti-CSRF tokens in forms and inspect headers for protections against clickjacking:
```bash
curl -I http://example.com/form_page
curl -I http://example.com
```
Look for anti-CSRF tokens in the response and verify the presence of the `X-Frame-Options` header.
