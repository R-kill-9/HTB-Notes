### Check for Commonly Used Application and Administrative URLs

- **Manual Testing**: Access common URLs like `/admin`, `/login`, `/dashboard`, `/config`, `/management`, `/admin.php`, etc.
- **Automated Tools**: Use tools like **Burp Suite** or **OWASP ZAP** with a predefined wordlist of common URLs.
- **Directory Brute-Forcing**: Tools like **Gobuster** or **Dirb** can help discover hidden URLs.
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

### Check for Old, Backup, and Unreferenced Files

- **Common File Extensions**: Look for backup files (`*.bak`, `*.old`, `*.backup`, `*.sql`, etc.) by brute-forcing potential paths or using web scanners.
- **Search for Unlinked Files**: Check if the server allows direct access to files that are not linked anywhere on the website.
- **Tools**: Use **Dirsearch** or **ffuf**.

```bash
dirsearch -u http://example.com -e bak,old,backup
```



### Check HTTP Methods Supported and Cross-Site Tracing (XST)

- **Check Allowed HTTP Methods**: Use **curl** or **nmap** to check the allowed HTTP methods on a server.### Check HTTP Methods Supported and Cross-Site Tracing (XST)

- **Check Allowed HTTP Methods**: Use **curl** or **nmap** to check the allowed HTTP methods on a server.
```bash
curl -X OPTIONS http://example.com
```
or
```bash
nmap --script http-methods -p 80,443 example.com
```
- **Cross-Site Tracing (XST)**: Test for XST by sending a TRACE request.
```bash
curl -X TRACE http://example.com
```

### Test File Extensions Handling

- **Test Various File Extensions**: Access files with various extensions (e.g., `.php`, `.html`, `.txt`, `.pdf`) and see how the server handles them. Check for extension handling inconsistencies.
- **Commonly Exploitable Extensions**: Test for PHP code execution by uploading or accessing files with different extensions.
- **Tools**: Use **Burp Suite** to intercept requests and manipulate extensions.

### Test for Security HTTP Headers

- **Check Security Headers**: Use `curl` or a browser extension to check for security headers.
```bash
curl -I http://example.com
```
**Important Headers**: Check for the following headers:

- **CSP (Content Security Policy)**
	- Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature that helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks by allowing web developers to specify which sources of content are considered trusted. By defining rules in the HTTP header, such as where scripts, images, and styles can be loaded from, CSP reduces the risk of malicious content being executed in a web page, thereby enhancing overall security.
- **X-Frame-Options**
	- X-Frame-Options is a security header that protects websites from clickjacking attacks by controlling whether a web page can be embedded within a frame, iframe, or object. It can be set to three values: `DENY` (no rendering in a frame), `SAMEORIGIN` (can be framed only by pages from the same origin), or `ALLOW-FROM uri` (can be framed only by specified origins). This header helps ensure that users are not tricked into interacting with malicious content.
- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**
	￼￼C- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism that enforces secure (HTTPS) connections to a web server, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and protocol downgrades. When a server responds with the HSTS header, compliant browsers will automatically redirect any requests to the server to HTTPS for a specified duration, ensuring that all communication remains encrypted and secure.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**
	- X-Content-Type-Options is a security header that prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing the content type of a response away from the declared `Content-Type`. By setting this header to `nosniff`, web developers can ensure that browsers strictly adhere to the specified content type and do not treat files as a different type than intended, mitigating risks associated with improperly handled content.
- **X-XSS-Protection**
	- X-XSS-Protection is a security header used to enable the built-in cross-site scripting (XSS) filter in modern web browsers. When set to `1; mode=block`, it activates the filter and instructs the browser to block the page from rendering if an XSS attack is detected, rather than attempting to sanitize the response. This provides an additional layer of defense against XSS vulnerabilities in web applications.

#### Well configured headers example
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 24 Sep 2024 12:00:00 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trustedscripts.com
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```

### Test for Policies (e.g., Flash, Silverlight, robots)

- **Check for Flash and Silverlight**: Look for `*.swf` and `*.xap` files on the server and test their functionality.
- **Robots.txt**: Access `http://example.com/robots.txt` to check what paths are disallowed for web crawlers. This may reveal sensitive files.
```bash
curl http://example.com/robots.txt
```

### Test for Non-production Data in Live Environment, and Vice-versa

- **Identify Non-production Data**: Check for common test data or configurations that should not be in a production environment.
- **Manual Review**: Manually look through application features to see if there's any test data that could leak sensitive information.
- **Automated Scanners**: Tools like **Burp Suite** can help identify non-production settings or defaults.

### Check for Sensitive Data in Client-Side Code

- **View Source**: Check the page source or JavaScript files for hardcoded API keys, credentials, or sensitive information.
- **Browser Developer Tools**: Use Chrome Developer Tools or Firefox Developer Tools to inspect the Network tab for API calls.
- **Static Code Analysis**: If you have access to the source code, run static analysis tools to detect hardcoded secrets.
- **Tools**: Use **GitHub’s secret scanning** or **TruffleHog** to find sensitive data in the codebase.
