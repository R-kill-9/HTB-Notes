### Establish How Session Management is Handled in the Application

Understanding session management is vital for identifying potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Inspect Session Handling**: Use OWASP ZAP to capture requests and responses by configuring it as a proxy.
2. **Examine Login Requests**: Initiate a login process through ZAP, then check the **History** tab for the request to the login endpoint.
3. **Review Headers**: Select the login request and inspect the headers and body to understand how session management is configured (look for session tokens, their storage method, etc.).

### Check Session Tokens for Cookie Flags (httpOnly and Secure)

To ensure that session cookies are adequately protected:

1. **Capture Cookies**: When the application sets cookies after logging in, view these cookies in the **History** tab.
2. **Inspect Cookie Flags**: Click on the request that sets the cookies, and look in the **Response Headers** section for the `Set-Cookie` header. Verify that the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags are present.

### Check Session Cookie Scope (Path and Domain)

To check that the session cookies are appropriately scoped:

1. **Review Cookie Attributes**: After logging in, again inspect the cookies in the **History** tab.
2. **Validate Path and Domain**: Check the `Path` and `Domain` attributes of the session cookie in the `Set-Cookie` header to ensure they are limited to the appropriate scope.

### Check Session Cookie Duration (Expires and Max-Age)

To validate the lifespan of session cookies:

1. **Inspect Cookie Duration**: Look for the `Expires` or `Max-Age` attributes in the `Set-Cookie` header when you first log in.
2. **Verify Settings**: Ensure that the duration is reasonable for a session (not excessively long).

### Check Session Termination After a Maximum Lifetime

To test the applicationâ€™s behavior after a session timeout:

1. **Log In and Wait**: Log in through ZAP, then wait for a duration longer than the maximum session lifetime.
2. **Attempt Access**: Try to access a protected resource (e.g., a dashboard) using ZAP with the stored session token. Check the response to confirm that access is denied after the timeout.

### Check Session Termination After Logout

To confirm proper session invalidation on logout:

1. **Log In and Logout**: Log in using ZAP, then invoke the logout endpoint.
2. **Attempt to Access Protected Resource**: After logging out, use the same session token to access a protected resource. Confirm that the application denies access.

### Test to See if Users Can Have Multiple Simultaneous Sessions

To verify if multiple active sessions are allowed:

1. **Log In Multiple Times**: Use different browsers or incognito windows to log into the application simultaneously.
2. **Check Access**: Attempt to access the dashboard in both sessions using ZAP to see if access is granted.

### Test Session Cookies for Randomness

To assess the randomness of session tokens:

1. **Capture Multiple Tokens**: Send multiple requests to the login endpoint using ZAP and check the session tokens.
2. **Examine Randomness**: Review the tokens in the **History** tab to see if they appear sufficiently random.

### Confirm That New Session Tokens Are Issued on Login, Role Change, and Logout

To ensure that new tokens are issued during critical events:

1. **Log In and Change Role**: Log in, then perform a role change through ZAP.
2. **Capture New Tokens**: Check the responses to both actions and verify that a new session token is issued after logging in and changing the role.

### Test for Consistent Session Management Across Applications with Shared Session Management

To test session consistency across related applications:

1. **Log Into One Application**: Use ZAP to log into the first application.
2. **Access Another Application**: Try to access a protected resource in a second application using the same session token. Check for consistency in session state.

### Test for Session Puzzling

To test for session token reuse:

1. **Attempt Unauthorized Access**: Use ZAP to send a request with a session token from another user.
2. **Verify Response**: Check whether the application denies access, confirming it correctly associates actions with the appropriate user session.

### Test for CSRF and Clickjacking

To check for protections against CSRF and clickjacking:

1. **Inspect Form Pages**: Use ZAP to access form pages and look for anti-CSRF tokens in the HTML response.
2. **Check Clickjacking Protections**: Review the HTTP headers of the main application page for the presence of the `X-Frame-Options` header, which helps protect against clickjacking.
