### Test for User Enumeration

User enumeration occurs when an application provides different error messages or responses based on valid and invalid usernames during login attempts. This can allow attackers to identify valid usernames for further attacks. To test this, observe the application's responses when entering both valid and invalid usernames in the login form. Use ZAP’s active scanner to automate this process, and review the differences in responses.

### Test for Authentication Bypass

Authentication bypass vulnerabilities allow unauthorized users to access protected resources without proper authentication. To test for this, attempt to access secured endpoints directly by manipulating URL parameters, cookies, or session tokens. Analyze the application’s behavior when accessing these resources without valid credentials using ZAP's request editor.

### Test for Bruteforce Protection

Assess whether the application implements measures to prevent brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints. This includes checking for account lockouts after a set number of failed login attempts or implementing delays between successive attempts. Use ZAP to automate multiple login attempts and monitor the application's response to identify any protective measures in place.

### Test Password Quality Rules

Evaluate the password policies enforced during account creation and password changes. Ensure that the application requires strong passwords, such as minimum length and complexity. Test this by attempting to register or change a password using weak passwords and observing whether the application enforces its rules.

### Test Remember Me Functionality

Evaluate the "Remember Me" feature to ensure that persistent sessions are securely implemented. Check if sessions are stored safely and expire after a reasonable duration. Use ZAP to analyze cookies created during the login process with the "Remember Me" option selected to verify their security settings.

### Test for Autocomplete on Password Forms/Input

Inspect the password input fields to determine if the `autocomplete` attribute is set to "off." This prevents browsers from storing and autofilling sensitive data. Use ZAP's HTML view to inspect form fields and ensure that the password input fields do not have `autocomplete` enabled.

### Test Password Reset and/or Recovery

Test the password reset functionality for security flaws. Ensure the process requires proper identity validation and that any temporary tokens sent via email or SMS are secure and have expiration times. Use ZAP to initiate a password reset and analyze the flow for potential vulnerabilities.

### Test Password Change Process

Examine the password change mechanism to ensure it verifies the current password before allowing a change. Ensure notifications are sent upon password changes and that the new password meets security policies. Use ZAP to simulate changing a password and check for proper verification and notifications.

### Test CAPTCHA

Ensure that CAPTCHA is implemented on sensitive forms (e.g., login, password recovery) to mitigate automated attacks. Evaluate its effectiveness by attempting to bypass it using automated tools. Use ZAP to analyze forms and check the presence and challenge of CAPTCHA implementations.

### Test Multi-Factor Authentication

Assess whether multi-factor authentication (MFA) is available and functioning correctly. Ensure that it requires users to provide additional verification methods when logging in, especially for sensitive actions. Use ZAP to analyze the login flow and verify that MFA prompts occur as expected.

### Test for Logout Functionality Presence

Verify that the application has a logout feature that effectively terminates the session. Ensure users cannot access protected resources after logging out. Use ZAP to log in, log out, and attempt to access secured endpoints to confirm that session termination works properly.

### Test for Cache Management on HTTP (e.g., Pragma, Expires, Max-age)

Review HTTP headers related to caching to ensure sensitive pages (like login and password reset) are not cached. Proper configuration helps prevent unauthorized access to cached content. Use ZAP to inspect response headers for directives like `Pragma`, `Expires`, and `Cache-Control`.

### Test for Default Logins

Check for default or hard-coded credentials in the application, as many applications may ship with default usernames and passwords. Ensure these are changed during setup to prevent unauthorized access. Use ZAP to test login endpoints with common default credentials.

### Test for User-Accessible Authentication History

Evaluate whether users can access their authentication history in a secure manner. This feature can help users monitor unauthorized access attempts. Use ZAP to check if there is an endpoint for accessing this history and ensure it does not expose sensitive information.

### Test for Out-of-Channel Notification of Account Lockouts and Successful Password Changes

Ensure that the application sends notifications (like emails or SMS) when significant account actions occur, such as lockouts or password changes. This helps users monitor their accounts for suspicious activities. Use ZAP to simulate actions that should trigger notifications and check for their delivery.

### Test for Consistent Authentication Across Applications with Shared Authentication Schema / SSO

Verify that applications using Single Sign-On (SSO) maintain consistent authentication processes. Check that logging out from one application effectively logs the user out from all connected applications. Use ZAP to analyze session tokens and cookies across multiple applications to confirm consistent behavior.
