### Test for Path Traversal

Path traversal vulnerabilities allow attackers to access files and directories stored outside the intended folder structure, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information. To test for path traversal in ZAP, you can modify the parameters of requests made to the application. Use ZAP's request editor to manipulate URL parameters by adding sequences like `../../../../etc/passwd` to attempt accessing restricted files. After sending the request, observe the response; a successful attack would return the file’s contents or an error indicating the file exists.

### Test for Bypassing Authorization Schema

Bypassing authorization checks enables unauthorized users to access restricted areas or functionalities of an application. In ZAP, you can manually modify request parameters or headers to attempt access to restricted resources. For example, you might alter a request that requires authentication to see if you can retrieve data without valid credentials. You can also use ZAP's fuzzer to automate this process, sending various requests with altered parameters to identify potential vulnerabilities.

### Test for Vertical Access Control Problems (Privilege Escalation)

Vertical access control issues occur when users with insufficient privileges can access resources meant for higher-privileged users, potentially allowing privilege escalation. To test for this in ZAP, log in as a regular user and use the spider to crawl the application. After identifying admin functionalities, attempt to access these endpoints directly by modifying requests in the request editor. For instance, if an admin dashboard is accessible at `http://example.com/admin/dashboard`, try navigating there to see if the application permits access to a non-admin user.

### Test for Horizontal Access Control Problems

Horizontal access control problems arise when users at the same privilege level can access each other's resources. To test this with ZAP, first, log in as a regular user and capture the session token. Then, modify requests to access another user’s data, such as changing the user ID in a profile URL. For example, send a request like `http://example.com/user/profile?id=another_user_id` using the session token of the logged-in user. If the application allows this access, it indicates inadequate authorization checks between users with the same privilege level.

### Test for Missing Authorization

Missing authorization checks can expose sensitive endpoints, allowing unauthorized access. To test for this in ZAP, attempt to access sensitive resources directly without authentication. For example, navigate to an admin URL like `http://example.com/admin/dashboard` without being logged in. Use the ZAP interface to capture and modify requests to see if sensitive endpoints respond without authorization errors. If the application provides access, it signifies a critical security gap in its authorization controls.
