### Check SSL Version, Algorithms, Key Length

OWASP ZAP can help identify the SSL/TLS configuration of a target application.

1. **Initiate a Scan**: Start a new active scan against the target URL.
2. **Analyze SSL/TLS Information**: Once the scan is complete, navigate to the **Alerts** tab to find any SSL-related alerts.
3. **Examine SSL Configuration**: You can also check the **Sites** tab to right-click on the target site and select **Show in Browser** to view the SSL/TLS information, including the version and key length.

### Check for Digital Certificate Validity (Duration, Signature, and CN)

To check the validity of digital certificates using ZAP:

1. **Access the Target Site**: In the ZAP interface, enter the target URL and let ZAP load the site.
2. **View Certificate Details**: Once loaded, go to the **Sites** tab, right-click the target domain, and select **Show in Browser**.
3. **Inspect Certificate**: In the browser, click the padlock icon in the address bar, and navigate to the certificate details. Validate the start and end dates, the Common Name (CN), and the issuer details.

### Check Credentials Only Delivered Over HTTPS

To ensure that sensitive data is only submitted over HTTPS:

1. **Inspect the Login Form**: Use ZAP to capture the login request by configuring it as a proxy.
2. **Check the Request**: In the **History** tab, find the request corresponding to the login form submission. Ensure that the request URL starts with `https://`.
3. **Analyze Request Data**: Verify that the request body is sent over HTTPS, which should be evident in the history details.

### Check That the Login Form is Delivered Over HTTPS

To confirm that the login page itself is served over HTTPS:

1. **Access the Login Page**: Navigate to the login page using ZAP's built-in browser.
2. **Verify URL and Form Action**: Check the address bar for `https://`. Additionally, right-click on the login form and select **Inspect Element** to ensure the action attribute points to an HTTPS URL.

### Check Session Tokens Only Delivered Over HTTPS

To check if session tokens are transmitted securely:

1. **Capture Session Data**: While logged in, monitor the network traffic using ZAP. Go to the **History** tab.
2. **Inspect Cookies**: In the **Response** section of the login request, look for cookies containing session tokens.
3. **Verify Secure Flags**: Ensure that the cookies have the `Secure` flag set, which ensures they are transmitted only over HTTPS.

### Check if HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is in Use

To check for the presence of HSTS in the response headers:

1. **Send a Request**: Use ZAP to perform a request against the target site.
2. **Analyze Response Headers**: Once the response is received, navigate to the **History** tab and select the request.
3. **Inspect Response Headers**: In the **Response Headers** section, look for `Strict-Transport-Security`. Validate its directives, such as `max-age` and `includeSubDomains`, to ensure HSTS is correctly configured.
