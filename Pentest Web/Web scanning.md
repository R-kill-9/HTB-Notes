## nuclei
*Nuclei* is a vulnerability scanner that can be used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications and other services.
It can be used to identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, including:

- **Injection vulnerabilities:** These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a target application.
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities:** These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a web page that is then executed by a victim's browser.
- **SQL injection vulnerabilities:** These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into a web application, which can then be used to steal data or gain unauthorized access.
- **Authentication vulnerabilities:** These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to a system.

#### Parameters
| Option                  | Description                                                                           |

## Wmap

**WMAP** is a web application vulnerability scanner for **Kali Linux** that automates the process of finding security vulnerabilities in web applications. It is often used for identifying common web application flaws, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and remote file inclusion (RFI). It allows security professionals and penetration testers to perform comprehensive scans of websites and web services.

1. **Start WMAP**
```bash
# Open Metasploit
msfconsole
# Load wmap extension
load wmap
```
2. **Add site**
```bash
wmap_sites -a <target_ip>
```
3. **Add target**
```bash
wmap_targets -t <target_url>
```
4. **Run scan**
```bash
wmap_run -t
```
