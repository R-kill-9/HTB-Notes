# nuclei
*Nuclei* is a vulnerability scanner that can be used to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications and other services.
It can be used to identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, including:

- **Injection vulnerabilities:** These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a target application.
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities:** These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a web page that is then executed by a victim's browser.
- **SQL injection vulnerabilities:** These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into a web application, which can then be used to steal data or gain unauthorized access.
- **Authentication vulnerabilities:** These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to a system.
