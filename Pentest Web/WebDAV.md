**WebDAV** (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is an extension of HTTP that allows users to collaboratively edit and manage files on web servers. It supports file creation, deletion, and modification directly over the web, making it useful for remote content management and file sharing. 

## Davtest
**Davtest** is a tool for testing WebDAV servers. It checks for writable directories and uploads test files to evaluate potential exploitation options.

```bash
davtest -url <target_URL>
```

If the WebDAV server requires authentication, provide credentials using the `-auth` flag:

```bash
davtest -url http://example.com/webdav/ -auth <user>:<password>
```



## Cadaver
**Cadaver** is a command-line WebDAV client used to interact with WebDAV-enabled servers. It allows you to upload, download, manage, and delete files on a WebDAV server.

```bash
cadaver <URL>
```
