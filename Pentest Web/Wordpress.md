# wpscan
**WPScan** is a widely-used open-source security scanner specifically designed to detect vulnerabilities in WordPress websites.
- `--url `: Specifies the URL of the WordPress website you want to scan.
- `--enumerate`: Enumerates vulnerable plugins (`vp`), users (`u`), themes (`t`), and timthumbs (`p`).
- `--plugins-detection mixed`: Specifies the plugin detection mode. In this case, it's set to "mixed," which includes both passive and aggressive detection methods.
- `--passwords`: Specifies a file containing a list of passwords to use for brute force attacks.
- `--usernames`: Specifies a single username to use for brute force attacks.
- `--exclude-content-length`: Excludes the Content-Length header from requests.
- `--proxy`: Specifies a proxy to use for the scan.
- `--random-agent`: Uses a random User-Agent for each request.
- `--verbose`: Increases the verbosity level of the output, providing more detailed information about the scan process.
## Basic usage
```bash
wpscan --url <url>
```
## Other options
```bash
wpscan --enumerate vp,u,t,p \
       --plugins-detection mixed \
       --passwords /path/to/passwords.txt \
       --usernames admin \
       --exclude-content-length \
       --proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080 \
       --random-agent \
       --verbose
```

# xmlrpc.php
**xmlrpc.php** is a file that represents a feature of WordPress that enables data to be transmitted with HTTP acting as the transport mechanism and XML as the encoding mechanism.

#### Risks of xmlrpc.php

1. **Brute Force Attacks**: Attackers can automate login attempts via XML-RPC, bypassing traditional login protections.
2. **DDoS Attacks**: Attackers can exploit XML-RPC to send multiple requests, overloading the server or launching amplified DDoS attacks.
3. **Pingback Amplification**: Malicious pingback requests can be used to reflect traffic to other sites, creating a DDoS attack.
4. **Vulnerabilities**: Older WordPress versions may have exploitable bugs in `xmlrpc.php`, enabling remote code execution (RCE) or other attacks.
