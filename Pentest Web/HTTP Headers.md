- **Check Security Headers**: Use `curl` or a browser extension to check for security headers.
```bash
curl -I http://example.com
```
**Important Headers**: Check for the following headers:

- **CSP (Content Security Policy)**
    
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security feature that helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks by allowing web developers to specify which sources of content are considered trusted. By defining rules in the HTTP header, such as where scripts, images, and styles can be loaded from, CSP reduces the risk of malicious content being executed in a web page, thereby enhancing overall security.
- **X-Frame-Options**
    
    - X-Frame-Options is a security header that protects websites from clickjacking attacks by controlling whether a web page can be embedded within a frame, iframe, or object. It can be set to three values: `DENY` (no rendering in a frame), `SAMEORIGIN` (can be framed only by pages from the same origin), or `ALLOW-FROM uri` (can be framed only by specified origins). This header helps ensure that users are not tricked into interacting with malicious content.
- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**
    
    - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism that enforces secure (HTTPS) connections to a web server, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and protocol downgrades. When a server responds with the HSTS header, compliant browsers will automatically redirect any requests to the server to HTTPS for a specified duration, ensuring that all communication remains encrypted and secure.
- **X-Content-Type-Options**
    
    - X-Content-Type-Options is a security header that prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing the content type of a response away from the declared `Content-Type`. By setting this header to `nosniff`, web developers can ensure that browsers strictly adhere to the specified content type and do not treat files as a different type than intended, mitigating risks associated with improperly handled content.
- **X-XSS-Protection**
    
    - X-XSS-Protection is a security header used to enable the built-in cross-site scripting (XSS) filter in modern web browsers. When set to `1; mode=block`, it activates the filter and instructs the browser to block the page from rendering if an XSS attack is detected, rather than attempting to sanitize the response. This provides an additional layer of defense against XSS vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **Referrer-Policy**
    
    - The Referrer-Policy header governs how much referrer information (the URL of the page that linked to the resource) is passed when a user clicks a link to another page. This helps protect user privacy by controlling what information is sent to other sites. Policies can include `no-referrer`, `no-referrer-when-downgrade`, `same-origin`, and others.
- **Feature-Policy / Permissions-Policy**
    
    - The Feature-Policy (now called Permissions-Policy) header allows developers to enable or disable certain browser features and APIs in their web applications, such as camera, microphone, and geolocation. This helps reduce the attack surface and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive user information or features.
- **Cache-Control**
    
    - The Cache-Control header controls how and for how long the response can be cached by browsers and other intermediate caches. By setting appropriate values (like `no-store`, `no-cache`, or `max-age`), developers can ensure that sensitive information is not stored in caches, thus enhancing security.
