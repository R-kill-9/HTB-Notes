Protection against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is crucial to prevent attackers from exploiting an authenticated user's session to perform unauthorized actions. Below are important considerations and examples for verifying CSRF protection during a white-box security review:

#### Key Security Measures

1. **Enable CSRF Protection**: Ensure that CSRF protection is explicitly enabled in the application framework. Many modern web frameworks have built-in mechanisms to mitigate CSRF attacks.

```java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.csrf().enable()  // Explicitly enable CSRF protection
        .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/login", "/register").permitAll()
            .anyRequest().authenticated();
}
```

2. **Use CSRF Tokens**: Verify that the application generates and validates CSRF tokens for sensitive operations (e.g., form submissions). These tokens should be unique per session or request and tied to the user session.

```java
<form action="/transfer" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="unique_csrf_token_here">
    <input type="text" name="amount" placeholder="Amount">
    <input type="submit" value="Transfer">
</form>
```

Check that the server verifies the CSRF token on every sensitive request.

3. **Safe HTTP Methods**: Verify that non-idempotent operations (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE) are protected by CSRF tokens. Read-only operations (e.g., GET) should not change the application state and do not require CSRF protection.

4. **SameSite Cookies**: Ensure the application uses the `SameSite` cookie attribute, which adds an additional layer of defense by restricting cookies to same-site requests.

```java
@Bean
public CookieSerializer cookieSerializer() {
    DefaultCookieSerializer serializer = new DefaultCookieSerializer();
    serializer.setSameSite("Strict");  // or "Lax" for less restrictive policies
    return serializer;
}
```
