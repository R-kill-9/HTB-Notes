**Nmap (Network Mapper)**  allows users to scan networks, identify hosts, and determine open ports, services, and operating systems running on devices.
```bash
nmap  -sS -sCV -p21 <ip_address>
```

- `-sV` Shows the version of the service running on each port.
- `-sC` Uses additional scripts to gather more information.
- `-sS` Stealth scan.
- `-sn` Is used for a ping scan.
- `-sU` Scans the UDP ports. 
- `-p-` Scans all ports. 
- `-Pn` Skip recognition phase.
- `-O` Determines the operating system of the target.
- `-p <port>` Scans only the specified port number. 
- `-vvv` Increase verbosity.
- `--open` Only displays open ports.
- `-iL` allows you to specify a file containing a list of  IP addresses.
- `-PS` Sends TCP SYN packets to determine if a host is up. It's useful for network discovery when ICMP (ping) is blocked by firewalls.
- `--osscan-guess` Allows to make a guess of the operating system.
- `--min-rate` Specifies the minimum number of packets Nmap should send per second; increasing this number speeds up the scan. 
- `-T[0...5]` Sets the timing template, which controls the speed and aggressiveness of the scan.
- `-oN,-oG,-oX` Saves the scan results in a human-readable plain text format (-oN), in XML format (-oX) or in grepable format (-oG).

## Nmap scripts
In Kali Linux, **Nmap scripts** are located in the directory:   `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/`

These scripts, part of the **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)**, extend Nmap's functionality. They allow users to perform tasks such as:

- Vulnerability detection.
- Service enumeration.
- Brute-forcing.
- Exploiting specific vulnerabilities.

```bash
nmap --script <script-name> <target>
```

To understand what a specific **Nmap NSE script** does, you can use the `--script-help` option followed by the script's name.

```bash
nmap --script-help <script-name>
```

Use the `--script-args` flag to supply arguments to a script during an Nmap scan.

```bash
nmap --script <script-name> --script-args <argument1>=<value1>,<argument2>=<value2> <target>
```
